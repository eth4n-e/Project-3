ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project develops a text-based game which resembles dungeons and dragons. In this 
game you lead a team into a dungeon which is yours to explore. Explore rooms,
bargain with merchants, speak to NPCs, you can do it all! It's your adventure 
after all! However, this game isn't all sunshines and rainbows. At every corner
there could be traps and monsters waiting to kill you and your team. Are you
scared? Are you excited? Are you ready? If not, you better be. Get ready to lead
your team through the dungeon escape!
